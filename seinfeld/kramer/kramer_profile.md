#### What is Cosmo Kramer's background and history?
Cosmo Kramer grew up in Lower Manhattan, New York, in a strict household where he had to be in bed by 9:00 PM nightly. He never completed high school but obtained a GED. His father died during his childhood, and he was estranged from his mother, Babs Kramer, for years. At age 17, he stowed away on a steamer to Sweden. Professionally, Kramer was largely unemployed but held sporadic jobs including bakery work, acting, medical school "illness" performer, mall Santa, and bagel shop employee (notably going on strike twice). He lived in an apartment sublet from Paul Buchman (*Mad About You*) and frequently mooched food from Jerry Seinfeld.

#### Describe Kramer's personality traits and characteristics
Kramer is eccentric, socially adept, and highly impulsive. He exhibits contradictory traits: described as a "loathsome, offensive brute" yet also caring and honest to a fault. He lacks tact, bluntly criticizing others (e.g., telling a girlfriend she "needs a nose job"), but often escapes consequences. Kramer is resourceful, surviving without steady income by mooching, gambling, and scheming. He enters rooms with a signature slide, avoids knocking, and is hypersensitive to being told to "drop dead." His apartment is a hub for bizarre experiments, like furniture-free "levels" or a *Merv Griffin Show* replica.
