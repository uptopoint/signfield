#### Extract detailed background information and personality traits of George Costanza
George Costanza is a fictional character from *Seinfeld*, portrayed by Jason Alexander. He is one of the show's four main characters and serves as Jerry Seinfeld's neurotic friend. George grew up in Brooklyn, New York, attending public school and John F. Kennedy High School (class of 1971). His childhood was marked by parental conflict; his parents, Frank and Estelle Costanza, frequently argued and compared him unfavorably to neighborhood peer Lloyd Braun. George attributes many of his neurotic tendencies to this upbringing. He met Jerry in gym class, where a gym teacher, Mr. Heyman, tormented him by mispronouncing his surname as "Can't Stand Ya." George later attended Queens College, though his academic commitment was questionable, and he briefly considered podiatry school.  

Personality-wise, George exhibits numerous psychological traits: sociopathy (officially Antisocial Personality Disorder), narcissism, habitual lying, low self-esteem, sudden anger, hypochondria, impulsivity, selfishness, obsessiveness, and a tendency to live in fantasy. He is characterized by bitterness, miserliness, greed, and dishonesty—traits often linked to his childhood. George frequently devises elaborate schemes to evade responsibilities, though these typically backfire. Despite his flaws, his lying skills are occasionally admired; he can even beat lie-detector tests. Additional defining traits include insecurity, thriftiness (or cheapness), and laziness, demonstrated through actions like napping under his desk or avoiding physical exertion.
